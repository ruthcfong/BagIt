BagIt: Quick, Easy, and On-the-go

The Elevator Pitch:

Ever run to class for Chem 20 at 9am? Ever schedule 10am-3pm classes with no lunch breaks? 

School. Social. Sleep. Choose two of the three. Ironically, this common phrase fails to even mention the other silent but deadly S: sustenance.

Skipped meals plague college campuses all over the country. However it doesn't have to be this way. In today's increasingly technological world, a poll suggests that approximately 85% of Harvard students own a smart phone. One freshman complained that he would order his lunch to-go if it wasn't such a hassle. 

Enter BagIt : a quick and easy way for Harvard students to order bagged meals from their phones. 
No more ugly Harvard sites.
No more hungry tummies.
It's as easy as login, select, and submit.

No other technology is out there that does this. Now, on-the-go students can order and eat on-the-go.

BagIt - Coming soon to the App Store and web.
